# Mini-Portofolio-SQL
This is my first mini portofolio about data analysis using SQL. The dataset used in the mini portofolio is "Most Streamed Songs (All Time) on Spotify" taken from Kaggle. Additionally, the tool I used in creating this mini portofolio is MySQL. I hope you can understand and give suggestions or feedback if there are mistakes.
