# Mini-Portofolio-SQL
This is my first mini portfolio about data analysis using SQL. The dataset used in the mini portfolio is features.csv and streams.csv from Kaggle. Additionally, the tool I used in creating this mini portofolio is MySQL. I hope you can understand and give suggestions or feedback if there are mistakes.
