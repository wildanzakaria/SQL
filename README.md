# Mini-Portofolio-SQL
This is my first mini portfolio about data analysis using SQL. The dataset used in the mini portfolio is "Most Streamed Songs (All Time) on Spotify" from Kaggle. Additionally, the tool I used in creating this mini portofolio is MySQL. I hope you can understand and give suggestions or feedback if there are mistakes.
